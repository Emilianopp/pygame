## Pygame Project

I have always been very fond of videogames and wanted to experiment creating a clone of Space Invaders.

As a Christmas gift for my sister I designed this ameteour game with the use of images and items we are both fond of. 

The game follow basic controls using right and left arrow keys to manouver and spacebar to shoot projectile.
